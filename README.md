IN TASK 1:
  * I did it on Google Colab
  * We might first have to again install gradio(pip install gradio)
  * We have to upload the necessary files on Colab, copy their Path in respective places and the code will work.

IN TASK 2:
  * I did it on Kaggle itself
  * I think then it will run by itself
  * I request you to use GPU accelerator for this one...otherwise it takes too much time
